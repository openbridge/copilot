## Prompt: Identifying Key Drivers of Stranded Inventory

First, you will need to retrieve sp_fba_bulk_fix_stranded_inventory table for Bulk Fix Stranded Inventory using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for the following scenario. 

Imagine you're analyzing a situation where a significant portion of your inventory in fulfillment centers is stranded—meaning that these items are not actively listed for sale on Amazon. This could occur due to various reasons such as pricing errors, listing issues, or account suspensions. Your task is to dive into this data to identify patterns or trends that explain why certain products become stranded more frequently than others. For example, it may be crucial to analyze product categories with higher stranded rates versus those performing well. Additionally, you should consider external factors such as seasonality or changes in consumer demand that might correlate with spikes in stranded inventory levels.

### Detailed Instructions

1. Investigate which product categories have the highest volume of stranded inventory using sp_fba_bulk_fix_stranded_inventory.
2. Identify any correlations between specific SKUs and their historical performance leading up to becoming stranded.
3. Analyze whether seasonal trends influence stranding occurrences by looking at previous year data alongside current figures.

##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Total number of units stranded per category
- Average time items remain stranded before being reactivated
- Percentage change in sales before and after addressing stranding issues

##### Actionable Recommendations:
Based on your findings from the analysis of the sp_fba_bulk_fix_stranded_inventory data:

##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Total estimated revenue loss due to stranded inventory 
- Percentage recovery rate once corrective measures implemented post-analysis
