The purchased product report reveals invaluable insights that can help reconcile these differences by shedding light on what else customers are buying after clicking through your ads. This understanding is pivotal not only in evaluating current campaign efficacy but also in refining future initiatives by highlighting gaps where advertised products may be underperforming compared to complementary purchases made afterward.
