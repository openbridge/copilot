## Prompt 1: Analyzing Overstocked Units

A common challenge for e-commerce businesses is managing overstocked inventory effectively. With metrics such as excess units and days of supply readily available in the FBA Inventory report, an analyst can identify products that are not moving quickly enough through their sales funnel. For instance, if you notice a significant amount of excess inventory on items that have a high estimated storage fee due soon, it becomes essential to formulate strategies to move those units more rapidly. A comprehensive analysis might involve comparing seven-day sales against 90-day sales averages or assessing seasonal trends affecting product performance.
