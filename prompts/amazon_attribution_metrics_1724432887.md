## Prompt 1: Understanding Promoted vs. Total Conversions

First, you will need to retrieve amzn_attribution_metrics table for Amazon Attribution - Metrics using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for the following scenario. 

Imagine you're a data analyst tasked with evaluating an e-commerce campaign that has recently run multiple promotions on various products. Your goal is to understand how these promotions have influenced customer purchasing behavior on Amazon. Specifically, you want to compare promoted conversions against total conversions for each product associated with your campaigns. By analyzing these metrics side by side, you can gauge not just direct sales from promotional efforts (promoted conversions) but also how overall brand engagement has been affected (total conversions). This analysis can reveal valuable insights into whether customers are merely responding to discounts or if they are becoming more engaged with the brand as a whole due to marketing efforts outside of Amazon.

##### Analytical Tasks:
- Analyze both promoted and total conversions using the amzn_attribution_metrics table.
- Identify trends in customer engagement based on conversion types.
- Investigate correlations between promotional activities and overall brand halo effects.

##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Promoted Conversions
- Total Conversions
- Brand Halo Conversions
- Conversion Rate

##### Actionable Recommendations:
Based on your findings from the analysis of both conversion types, recommend adjustments in future marketing strategies that emphasize not only short-term sales boosts but also long-term brand loyalty.

## Prompt 2: Analyzing Full-Funnel Impact

First, you will need to retrieve amzn_attribution_metrics table for Amazon Attribution - Metrics using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for this scenario.

As an e-commerce analyst at a company launching a new product line through various external marketing channels like social media and email campaigns, it’s crucial to measure how these initiatives translate into actual purchases on Amazon. By focusing on total conversions that include attributed conversions across all products in your brand's catalog—not just those directly promoted—you can evaluate how well these non-Amazon marketing efforts drive broader engagement and sales across your entire range of offerings. The relationship between these metrics provides insight into whether customers are developing an affinity for your brand or simply reacting favorably to targeted promotions.

##### Analytical Tasks:
- Compare total conversions against non-Amazon marketing spend over time.
- Evaluate which external channels yield higher brand halo effects via total conversions.
  
##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Total Conversions
- Cost per Acquisition (CPA)
- Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS)

##### Actionable Recommendations:
Based on observed patterns in total conversion performance correlated with specific marketing channels, suggest reallocating budget towards those that demonstrate stronger impacts on overall sales growth.

##### Analytical Tasks:

- Assess which points in their experience lead effectively toward higher conversion rates among consumers utilizing promoted offers versus general branding exposure.

##### Metrics & KPIs:
