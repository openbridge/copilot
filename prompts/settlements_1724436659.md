## Prompt 1: Understanding Settlement Trends Over Time

First, you will need to retrieve the sp_settlements table for Settlements using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for the following scenario. A data analyst might encounter a situation where they need to evaluate how settlement amounts change over multiple periods. The goal is to identify trends that could indicate seasonality or impacts from marketing campaigns. By analyzing two or more consecutive settlement reports (typically posted every two weeks), analysts can determine if fluctuations in pay correlate with specific promotional activities or changes in referral fees and refunds.

### Detailed Instructions
##### Analytical Tasks:
- Retrieve data from sp_settlements for at least three consecutive settlement periods.
- Compare total amounts settled each period and calculate percentage changes.
- Identify any correlation between increases/decreases in settlements and external factors such as advertising spend or seasonal promotions.

##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Total amount settled per period.
- Percentage change in settlement amounts across periods.
- Average referral fees and refunds impacting settlements during each period.

##### Actionable Recommendations:
Based on trend analysis of settlements over time:
1. Adjust marketing strategies based on peak settlement periods identified through this analysis.
2. Optimize product pricing by understanding how referral fees influence overall profitability during high-sales seasons.

## Prompt 2: Impact Assessment of Refunds on Settlement Balances

First, you will need to retrieve the sp_settlements table for Settlements using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for this scenario. Refunds can significantly impact account balances before settlements are processed. Analyzing how refunds correlate with negative balances can help sellers understand their financial standing better and strategize accordingly. Evaluating these dynamics allows businesses to mitigate losses effectively while maintaining customer satisfaction through refund processes.

### Detailed Instructions
##### Analytical Tasks:
- Analyze sp_settlements data focusing on periods when there were significant refunds issued.
- Determine how these refunds impacted overall account balances leading up to settlement dates.
  
##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Total value of refunds issued during each settlement period.
- Average account balance before settlements compared with periods without major refund activity.
  
##### Actionable Recommendations:
1. Implement proactive measures such as revisiting return policies or enhancing product descriptions based on refund patterns observed through analysis.
2. Consider adjusting inventory levels based on anticipated returns during high-refund periods identified in your dataset.

## Prompt 3: Evaluating Referral Fees' Influence on Settlement Payments

First, you will need to retrieve the sp_settlements table for Settlements using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for this scenario. Referral fees are an essential part of selling costs that directly affect net profit margins after sales are made but before payments are settled. Understanding how variations in referral fee structures impact final settlement amounts can provide insights into profitability trends over time.

### Detailed Instructions
##### Analytical Tasks:
- Examine sp_settlements records that include detailed breakdowns of referral fees alongside total payments settled.
- Calculate average referral fee percentages relative to total sales during different settlement cycles.

##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Average referral fee percentage applied per sale within given reporting intervals.
- Total deducted referral fees versus total settled payment across all transactions reviewed.

##### Actionable Recommendations:
1. Assess whether current product pricing adequately accounts for fluctuating referral fees; adjust prices if needed to maintain profitability margins observed in historical analyses.
2. Investigate alternative selling methods or platforms if consistently high referral fees detract significantly from net revenue post-settlement analysis.
