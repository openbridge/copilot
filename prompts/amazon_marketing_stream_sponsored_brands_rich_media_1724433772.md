## Prompt 1: Understanding Video Performance Impact

First, you will need to retrieve the amzn_stream_sb_rich_media table for Amazon Marketing Stream - Sponsored Brands Rich Media using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for the following scenario. 

Consider a situation where an e-commerce brand has recently launched a new video advertisement as part of their Sponsored Brands campaign on Amazon. The marketing team is eager to understand how this video is performing in terms of impressions and views over its first few days of launch. It’s critical for them to analyze not just raw numbers but also how these figures translate into potential customer engagement and conversion rates.

The data analyst will need to look at both immediate impressions and views as well as evaluate any adjustments that may occur within 72 hours due to invalidation processes. Given that it can take up to 12 hours for data to populate after an event occurs, understanding the latency in reporting is crucial. By focusing on trends in performance metrics such as view-through rates (VTR), cost-per-view (CPV), and click-through rates (CTR), they can derive actionable insights into audience engagement levels.

##### Analytical Tasks:

With validation being crucial—given that impressions or views can be invalidated within 72 hours—it’s essential to track not only immediate performance but also historical trends over time.
