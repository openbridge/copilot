## Prompt 1: Inventory Optimization through SnS Metrics

First, you will need to retrieve sp_fba_sns_performance table for Subscribe & Save Performance using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for the following scenario. Imagine you are an analyst tasked with identifying inventory challenges in your Subscribe & Save offerings. By analyzing the trailing four-week performance data—such as items shipped and orders missed due to stockouts—you can pinpoint which SKUs are underperforming. For instance, if you notice a high percentage of missed orders coupled with low shipment volumes for certain products, it could indicate that your inventory levels are not aligned with demand. This analysis can guide you in adjusting purchase orders or re-evaluating promotional strategies to enhance availability and meet customer expectations.

##### Analytical Tasks:

## Prompt 2: Pricing Strategy Evaluation

First, you will need to retrieve sp_fba_sns_performance table for Subscribe & Save Performance using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for this scenario. Assume you're examining how pricing strategies affect subscription renewal rates among customers. By reviewing average discount percentages alongside average sale prices within your SnS report data over recent weeks, you can uncover correlations between pricing adjustments and customer retention in subscriptions. For example, if higher discounts correlate with increased renewals but also show diminishing returns on profit margins per unit sold, this could indicate a need for recalibration in pricing strategy without sacrificing customer loyalty.

##### Analytical Tasks:
- Compare average discounts offered against renewal rates from previous periods.
  
##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Average discount percentage across all SKUs.
