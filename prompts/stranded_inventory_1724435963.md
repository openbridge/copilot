2. Cross-reference these with historical sales data and pricing trends to identify any anomalies that may correlate with their current status.
3. Examine product listings for common issues that may lead to stranding.

##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Number of units per SKU in stranded inventory

### Detailed Instructions 
##### Analytical Tasks:
1. Analyze trends in stranded inventory across different seasons by examining historical data within sp_fba_stranded_inventory.

1. Utilize competitive analysis tools alongside sp_fba_stranded_inventory data to see how competitor actions correlate with increases in your own stranded inventory.
