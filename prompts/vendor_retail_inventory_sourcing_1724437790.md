## Prompt 1: Evaluating Sellable On Hand Units

First, you will need to retrieve the sp_vendor_inventory_sourcing table for Vendor Retail - Inventory Sourcing using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for the following scenario. 

Imagine you're a data analyst tasked with analyzing sellable on hand units across various ASINs in your catalog. Your goal is to identify trends that may affect inventory availability. You pull data on sellable on hand units and vendor confirmation rates at both aggregate levels and ASIN-specific levels over daily and weekly intervals. This allows you to pinpoint which products are consistently underperforming or overstocked based on sales forecasts and seasonal demand fluctuations. By monitoring these metrics closely through weekly updates, you can quickly respond to unfavorable trends—such as declining sellable units—which may indicate potential stockouts or excess inventory situations.

#### Detailed Instructions

##### Analytical Tasks:
- Retrieve relevant data from the sp_vendor_inventory_sourcing table focusing on sellable on hand units.
- Identify ASINs with significant fluctuations in inventory levels over recent weeks.
- Investigate how vendor confirmation rates correlate with changes in sellable on hand units.

##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Monitor average weekly sellable on hand units per ASIN.
- Calculate vendor confirmation rate percentages over time.
- Track inventory turnover ratios for optimal stock management.

##### Actionable Recommendations:
Based on analysis findings, consider implementing automated reorder alerts when stock drops below defined thresholds or conducting further investigation into low vendor confirmation rates that could impact overall operational health.

## Prompt 2: Analyzing Vendor Confirmation Rates

First, you will need to retrieve the sp_vendor_inventory_sourcing table for Vendor Retail - Inventory Sourcing using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for the following scenario.

As an e-commerce analyst focused on improving operational efficiency, you are asked to analyze vendor confirmation rates and their impacts on product availability. By examining this metric alongside other operational health indicators such as return rates and order fulfillment times across various vendors in your catalog—reported at both aggregate levels and ASIN levels—you can gauge whether consistent vendor behavior contributes positively or negatively to your supply chain efficiency. The objective here is not just identifying problematic vendors but also leveraging high-performing vendors' practices as benchmarks within your organization.

#### Detailed Instructions

##### Analytical Tasks:
- Access data from sp_vendor_inventory_sourcing related specifically to vendor confirmation rates.
- Compare performance metrics between high-performing vendors versus those with lower confirmation rates.
  
##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Examine monthly trends of vendor confirmation rate percentages.
- Measure any correlations between high/low confirmation rates and customer satisfaction ratings.

##### Actionable Recommendations:
Encourage collaboration with underperforming vendors by sharing best practices from successful ones or consider renegotiating terms based on their reliability scores derived from historical data analysis.

## Prompt 3: Identifying Unfavorable Trends 

First, you will need to retrieve the sp_vendor_inventory_sourcing table for Vendor Retail - Inventory Sourcing using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for this scenario.

In a dynamic e-commerce environment where consumer preferences rapidly shift, identifying unfavorable trends early is crucial. You might find yourself analyzing weeks’ worth of inventory data looking for patterns indicating potential problems—like increasing instances of unsold products or dips in vendor fulfillment capabilities measured by both sellable units available versus sold items tracked through daily updates. This comprehensive view enables proactive decision-making rather than reactive measures when it comes time to adjust marketing efforts or restock policies based solely on past performance without predictive insights guiding future actions.

#### Detailed Instructions

##### Analytical Tasks:
- Use sp_vendor_inventory_sourcing metrics to detect variations in sales velocity relative to available inventory counts.
  
##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Calculate week-over-week changes in unsold product quantities alongside average sales volume per ASIN.
  
##### Actionable Recommendations:
Develop targeted promotions or discounts aimed at slow-moving items identified during analysis while simultaneously increasing visibility through marketing channels tailored toward moving excess stock efficiently before it results in markdowns post-season sale periods.
