## Prompt 1: Understanding Search Term Performance 

First, you will need to retrieve the sp_ba_search_terms_by_quarter table for Brand Analytics Search Terms Analysis - Quarterly using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for the following scenario. Consider a hypothetical e-commerce business that has recently launched a new product line on Amazon. The brand's marketing team wants to identify which search terms are driving traffic and conversions. 

The report reveals various search terms with their frequency ranks. For example, "wireless earbuds" may rank high in searches but yield low click share on their product listing due to stiff competition from established brands. Conversely, "affordable wireless earbuds" might have lower search frequency yet demonstrate higher click share and conversion rates as it targets price-sensitive consumers. Analyzing this data allows the business to adjust its listings and marketing strategy accordingly.

##### Analytical Tasks:
- Identify top-performing search terms that lead customers to your products.
- Compare click share versus conversion share among competing products for each term.
- Use the sp_ba_search_terms_by_quarter data to explore trends over multiple quarters.

##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Click share percentage by product.
- Conversion rate by search term.
- Changes in ranking over time for both keywords and products.

##### Actionable Recommendations:
- Optimize product listings based on high-click-share terms with low conversion rates.
- Invest in advertising campaigns targeting underutilized but relevant search terms that show potential growth.

## Prompt 2: Competitive Positioning through Keyword Insights

First, you will need to retrieve the sp_ba_search_terms_by_quarter table for Brand Analytics Search Terms Analysis - Quarterly using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for this scenario where a brand seeks competitive insights regarding keyword performance in their niche.

Imagine two similar brands competing in kitchen appliances. The analysis shows that while both brands appear under similar search queries such as "best blender," one brand captures significantly more clicks and conversions than its competitor. By examining customer behavior post-search – looking at what products were clicked after searching these terms – analysts can deduce why one brand prevails over another.

##### Analytical Tasks:
- Assess how competitors perform against key search terms related to your product categories.
- Track shifts in click share between your brand’s products compared with competitors over several quarters.
  
##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Market share represented by click shares across different keywords.
- Customer engagement metrics post-search (e.g., time spent on product pages).

##### Actionable Recommendations:
- Develop targeted marketing strategies focusing on high-value keywords where competitors are currently weak or less optimized.

## Prompt 3: Seasonal Trends Impacting Keyword Searches 

First, you will need to retrieve sp_ba_search_terms_by_quarter table for Brand Analytics Search Terms Analysis - Quarterly using the Openbridge API. Next, use this data within a seasonal context where an e-commerce company needs insight into how seasonal changes affect consumer interest in specific categories like outdoor furniture during summer months or holiday decorations during Q4.

With historical quarterly data at hand, analysts can identify spikes in certain searches leading up to seasons or events (e.g., “outdoor patio set” increases just before summer). This knowledge allows teams not only to prepare inventory better but also shape promotional campaigns tailored around these trends based on past performance results.

##### Analytical Tasks:
- Investigate how specific seasons or events influence keyword popularity within target markets.
  
##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Year-over-year comparison of keyword popularity around significant holidays or events.
  
##### Actionable Recommendations:
- Schedule promotions aligned with identified peaks in relevant searches; adjust inventory levels ahead of projected demand surges.
