## Prompt 1: Analyzing Daily Glance Views Trends

First, you will need to retrieve sp_vendor_traffic table for Selling Partner Vendor Sales - Traffic using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for the following scenario. Imagine you're an e-commerce analyst tasked with evaluating how daily glance views (GVs) fluctuate over time for specific ASINs in your product catalog. Your goal is to identify any patterns or anomalies that correlate with marketing campaigns or seasonal trends. By analyzing GVs at both aggregate and ASIN levels on a daily basis, you can pinpoint which products garner more attention during certain periods and understand how effectively retail traffic converts into sales when Retail holds the featured offer.

##### Analytical Tasks:
- Examine daily GVs across selected ASINs from the sp_vendor_traffic table.
- Identify peak days correlating with marketing efforts or promotions.
- Assess whether higher GVs lead to increased conversion rates within those periods.

##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Total Glance Views (GVs)
- Conversion Rate (CR) associated with GVs
- Average Daily Glance Views per ASIN

##### Actionable Recommendations:
Based on the analysis of daily glance views trends, develop targeted marketing strategies focused on high-performing products during peak traffic days. Additionally, consider adjusting inventory based on anticipated spikes in customer interest driven by seasonal changes or campaigns.

## Prompt 2: Evaluating Impact of Featured Offers on Glance Views

First, you will need to retrieve sp_vendor_traffic table for Selling Partner Vendor Sales - Traffic using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for this scenario. As an analyst examining retail performance data in Brand Analytics reporting, investigate how being featured as a seller impacts glance views at an ASIN level. Your objective is to determine if there are significant differences in GVs when your products are marked as 'featured' versus non-featured times. Understanding this dynamic can help refine pricing strategies and promotional tactics.

##### Analytical Tasks:
- Compare GVs between featured and non-featured ASIN instances.
- Analyze traffic changes before and after becoming a featured seller.
- Look into external factors that could influence these metrics such as competitor actions or advertising spend.

##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Number of Featured Offer Days 
- Difference in GVs between featured vs. non-featured status
- Percentage Change in GVs post-featuring 

##### Actionable Recommendations:
If being featured significantly boosts glance views but not conversions equally well, consider revisiting product descriptions or imagery used during those periods to improve overall sales performance.

##### Analytical Tasks:
- Investigate correlations between ad spend related to promotions and fluctuations in GVs.
- Study historical data around major shopping events (e.g., Prime Day) alongside regular sales periods.
- Gather market intelligence on competitor activities that may affect viewer attention toward your listings.

##### Metrics & KPIs:
