## Prompt: Understanding Product Performance Metrics

First, you will need to retrieve dsp_products table for Amazon DSP - Products using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for the following scenario. Imagine you are a data analyst tasked with assessing how specific products featured in your advertising campaigns are performing over time.

By focusing on these metrics can reveal trends and patterns that may indicate which products are successfully engaging customers or which ones may require further optimization in their marketing strategy. For instance, if a product is generating high impressions but low conversions compared to others in its category, it could suggest that while there is interest in the product itself (as evidenced by click-through rates), there may be issues with pricing or presentation that deter potential buyers from completing their purchases.
