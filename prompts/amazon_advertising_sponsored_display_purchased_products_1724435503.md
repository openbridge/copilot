## Prompt 1: Uncovering New Opportunities

First, you will need to retrieve the amzn_ads_sd_purchased_products table for Amazon Advertising Sponsored Display - Purchased Products using the Openbridge API. Next, use the information from the API for the following scenario. As an e-commerce data analyst working with a seller who has launched multiple campaigns on both Sponsored Display and Sponsored Products platforms, you notice that while there is steady traffic and engagement on their ads, sales seem limited to only advertised ASINs. By diving deep into the purchased products report generated from non-advertised ASINs after ad clicks, you can begin identifying patterns in consumer behavior and preferences that may not have been apparent before. This analysis aims to surface new advertising opportunities by focusing on what customers are actually buying post-click—insights that could lead to improved targeting or even new product offerings tailored to customer interests.

#### Detailed Instructions
##### Analytical Tasks:
- Examine how many purchases were made for non-advertised ASINs after clicking on ads.
- Identify trends in these purchases over time (e.g., seasonal trends).
- Assess which non-advertised ASINs are most frequently purchased alongside advertised products.

##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Other SKU Sales (from non-advertised products).
- Click-through rates (CTR) from ads leading to these purchases.
- Conversion rates specific to non-advertised products.

Based on findings from this analysis, recommend adjustments in advertising strategies such as bundling advertised items with frequently purchased non-advertised items or creating targeted campaigns around popular non-advertised SKUs.

## Prompt 2: Assessing Performance Impact

First, you will need to retrieve the amzn_ads_sd_purchased_products table for Amazon Advertising Sponsored Display - Purchased Products using the Openbridge API.

Using conversion metrics exclusively focused on non-advertised products provides a unique vantage point; it allows analysts to evaluate indirect impact stemming from ad interactions without directly linking them back through typical attribution models. You’ll analyze whether consumers are buying complementary items that enhance overall brand loyalty—even if those items aren’t actively promoted through direct ads—allowing businesses to better align their marketing efforts across various channels.

#### Detailed Instructions
##### Analytical Tasks:
- Compare total sales of non-advertised SKUs against total ad clicks over specific periods.
- Analyze correlation between increased ad spend and subsequent sales of related non-advertised products.

##### Metrics & KPIs:
- Total revenue generated by Other SKU Sales.
- Ratio of ad clicks leading directly versus indirectly (through other purchases) affecting total sales volume.

##### Actionable Recommendations:
Advise vendors on optimizing their budgets based on identified correlations—potentially suggesting reallocating funds towards high-performing categories even if they don’t yield immediate returns via direct advertisement but foster long-term growth through customer retention and upselling opportunities.
